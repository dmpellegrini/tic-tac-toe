# Danny's Game of Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to Danny's Game of Tic Tac Toe.

The game is simple. You find two players and each one takes a turn and if they 
get three squares in a row they win.

## How To Use 

1. Simply load up the webpage and alternate taking turns with red and blue squares
1. When a player has won or there is a tie, the game will notify you and then auto-reset 

### Technical Specs 

- The game runs in one function called makeBoard()
- The game is recursive so when a player has won or there is a tie the function calls itself again.
